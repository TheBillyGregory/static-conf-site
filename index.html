        <h3><span>/ </span>The Event</h3>
        <p>We are pleased to announce #a11yTO Conf; our inaugural #a11yTO conference! </p>
        <p>On September 28 and 29 we will open the doors at Telus Digital, in downtown Toronto, to over 250 attendees for two full days of accessibility training!  </p>
        <p>#a11yTO always welcomes new people into our community, at camp, at our Meetups, or to accessibility in general. #a11yTO Conf will build off this momentum while engaging our attendees with a schedule unlike any other event. Our 2-day, 1-track conference will be comprised of a carefully curated “playlist” of lectures, demos, lightning talks, and workshops. </p>
        <p>This unheralded mix of presentation and learning styles will provide a unique and immersive learning experience that differs from our yearly camp while holding ourselves to the level of quality attendees have grown to expect from the #a11yTO brand. </p>
        <p>We’re also hoping to introduce other special events throughout the week leading up to the conference. These would include activities such as guided tours of local museums, galleries, and other locations.</p>
